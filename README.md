# Spt Shufflr

This is a terminal program to shuffle you're spotify playlist!

I have written this because i was tired of the spotify shuffle function, that is actually not shuffling at random.

If you want to set this up you have to create a spotify app on <https://developer.spotify.com/> and set the callbackUri to <http://localhost:8888/callback>.

Follow the **.env.example** file and create a .env file with you're spotify app clientId and clientSecret.
